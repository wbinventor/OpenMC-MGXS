\subsection{Energy Condensation}
\label{subsec:energy-condense}

The \texttt{MGXS.get_condensed_xs(...)} method


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Pin-Wise Spatial Homogenization}
\label{subsec:pinwise-homogenize}

The \texttt{MGXS.get_subdomain_avg_xs(...)} method

\subsection{Microscopic MGXS}
\label{subsec:micro-macro}

Ummm, I hear it is unique that we can calculate micros?


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Scattering Moments}
\label{subsec:scatt-moments}

Up to tenth order scattering moment matrices.

\subsection{Isotropic in Lab Scattering}
\label{subsec:iso-in-lab}

For benchmarking with isotropic multi-group codes. Also useful more generally to quantify the impact of anisotropic scattering sources.
