\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Python API\cite{boyd2016bigdata}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tally Data Processsing}
\label{subsec:pyapi}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Python-based tools for ``big data'' applications
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item tally arithmetic
    \item tally slicing/merging
    \item distributed cell tallies\cite{lax2014distribcell}
    \end{itemize}
\item leverage the hell out of NumPy\cite{walt2011numpy}
\item Pandas DataFrames\cite{mckinney2010pandas}
\item intro features here and reference when describing \texttt{openmc.mgxs} later?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-Group Mode}
\label{subsec:openmc-mg-mode}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item support stochastic multi-group calculations
\item multiple scattering representations (Legendre moments, discrete bins)
\item use OpenMC to generate MGXS, then insert into identical model for MG calculation
\item mention angular-dependent MGXS, or save for later paper?
\end{itemize}
