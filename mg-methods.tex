\section{Multigroup Transport Methods}
\label{sec:mg-theory}

A key trend in recent years has been the steady progress toward full-core neutron transport-based reactor analysis tools. Transport-based methods for reactor physics apply a variety of approximations to solve the following form of the steady-state Boltzmann transport equation,

\begin{dmath}
\label{eqn:transport-ce}
\mathbf{\Omega} \cdot \nabla \psi(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega},E) + \Sigma_{t}(\mathbf{r},E)\psi(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega},E) = \int\displaylimits_{0}^{\infty}\int\displaylimits_{4\pi} \Sigma_{s}(\mathbf{r},{\mathbf{\Omega'}\rightarrow\mathbf{\Omega}},{E'\rightarrow E}) \psi(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega'},E') \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega'} \mathrm{d}E' + \frac{1}{k_{\textrm{eff}}}\int\displaylimits_{0}^{\infty}\int\displaylimits_{4\pi} \nu\Sigma_{f}(\mathbf{r},{\mathbf{\Omega'}\rightarrow \mathbf{\Omega}},{E'\rightarrow E})\psi(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega'},E') \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega'} \mathrm{d}E'\,,
\end{dmath}

\noindent which is integro-differential in the neutron angular flux $\psi(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega},E)$ in space $\mathbf{r}$, direction of travel $\mathbf{\Omega}$, and energy $E$. The equation depends on the macroscopic total, scattering, and fission production cross sections $\Sigma_{t}$, $\Sigma_{s}$, and $\nu\Sigma_{f}$, respectively, and the eigenvalue $k_{\textrm{eff}}$ of the critical system.

The accurate determination of the neutron flux is challenged primarily by the complicated energy structure of the cross sections. Monte Carlo transport methods are able to exactly treat the energy dependence in \cref{eqn:transport-ce}\footnote{The treatment is only as exact as the uncertainties in measured nuclear cross section data will permit.}, but they are computationally burdensome and impractical for routine nuclear reactor analysis. Deterministic methods do not make use of continuous energy cross sections and instead rely on multigroup constants as a result of several simplifying approximations to \cref{eqn:transport-ce}, including energy and spatial discretization, angular expansion of the scattering kernel, and an isotropic fission source. The deterministic OpenMOC transport code \textcolor{red}{(see \cref{subsec:openmoc})} used in this paper solves the following form of the multigroup transport equation,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:transport-mg}
\mathbf{\Omega} \cdot \nabla \psi_{g}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega}) + \Sigma_{tr,g}\psi_{g}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\Omega}) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \sum_{g'=1}^{G} \Sigma_{s,k,g' \rightarrow g}\phi_{g'}(\mathbf{r}) + \frac{\chi_{k,g}}{4\pi k_{\textrm{eff}}}\sum_{g'=1}^{G} \nu\Sigma_{f,k,g'}\phi_{g'}(\mathbf{r})\,,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the subscript $k$ corresponds to the discretized spatial mesh cell $k$ and energy group $g \in \left\{1, 2, \ldots, G\right\}$ spans a range of energies from $\left[E_{g}, E_{g-1}\right]$. This form of the equation depends on the angular- and energy-integrated scalar flux $\phi_g$. The multigroup transport-corrected total cross section $\Sigma_{tr,k,g}$, isotropic group-to-group scattering matrix $\Sigma_{s,k,g'\rightarrow g}$, fission production cross section $\nu\Sigma_{f,k,g}$ and fission energy spectrum $\chi_{k,g}$ must be precomputed and supplied as parameters to multigroup codes that solve this form of the multigroup transport equation.
